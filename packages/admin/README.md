# core/admin

**Bounded context:** `admin`
**Responsibility:** Core Admin: operator console for projects, credentials, transactions, wallets, fee rules, providers, webhooks, audit and reconciliation.
**Delivery lot:** Lot 6 — see [the delivery plan](../../docs/Plan_Delivery_MVP_Core_System.docx)

## Internal structure

This module is layered (hexagonal); the dependency direction is inward only:

```
Presentation ─┐
Infrastructure ┼─► Application ─► Domain
              ─┘
```

| Directory         | Contains                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/Domain`      | Pure PHP: entities, value objects, domain events, exceptions, **ports**   |
| `src/Application` | Use cases and their DTOs; transactional orchestration                     |
| `src/Infrastructure` | Port implementations: Eloquent persistence, HTTP/provider adapters    |
| `src/Presentation`| HTTP controllers, requests, resources, middleware, console commands       |
| `src/Contracts`   | **Published API** — the only part other modules may depend on             |

Both directions are enforced by Deptrac (`deptrac.yaml`): `Domain` may not reference
Laravel, Eloquent or `Infrastructure`, and no other module may reference anything of
this one outside `Contracts/`.

## Module dependencies

Allowed (via their `Contracts/` only):

- `core/audit`
- `core/billing`
- `core/events`
- `core/fees`
- `core/identity`
- `core/ledger`
- `core/notification`
- `core/parties`
- `core/payment`
- `core/wallet`
- `core/webhook`

Any other cross-module dependency fails CI.

## Ground rules

- No application — internal or external — reads this module's tables. Consumers use the
  Core's versioned API and its events.
- Cross-context data is joined by correlation identifiers (`external_ref`,
  `correlation_id`), never by a database join across contexts.
- Every monetary mutation is idempotent and every state change that others care about is
  published through the transactional outbox, inside the same transaction.
