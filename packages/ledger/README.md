# core/ledger

**Bounded context:** `ledger`
**Responsibility:** Immutable double-entry ledger, accounts, materialized balances. The financial core: depends on no other module.
**Delivery lot:** Lot 2 — see [the delivery plan](../../docs/Plan_Delivery_MVP_Core_System.docx)

## Internal structure

This module is layered (hexagonal); the dependency direction is inward only:

```
Presentation ─┐
Infrastructure ┼─► Application ─► Domain
              ─┘
```

| Directory         | Contains                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/Domain`      | Pure PHP: entities, value objects, domain events, exceptions, **ports**   |
| `src/Application` | Use cases and their DTOs; transactional orchestration                     |
| `src/Infrastructure` | Port implementations: Eloquent persistence, HTTP/provider adapters    |
| `src/Presentation`| HTTP controllers, requests, resources, middleware, console commands       |
| `src/Contracts`   | **Published API** — the only part other modules may depend on             |

Both directions are enforced by Deptrac (`deptrac.yaml`): `Domain` may not reference
Laravel, Eloquent or `Infrastructure`, and no other module may reference anything of
this one outside `Contracts/`.

## Module dependencies

**None.** This module sits at the bottom of the stack and may not depend on any other bounded context (Deptrac enforces this).

## Ground rules

- No application — internal or external — reads this module's tables. Consumers use the
  Core's versioned API and its events.
- Cross-context data is joined by correlation identifiers (`external_ref`,
  `correlation_id`), never by a database join across contexts.
- Every monetary mutation is idempotent and every state change that others care about is
  published through the transactional outbox, inside the same transaction.
